## Contract Advisor RAG
### Towards Building A High-Precision Legal Expert LLM APP
Welcome to the Contract Advisor RAG project! Our goal is to develop a cutting-edge AI application that leverages Hybrid LLM (Language Model) technology to create a high-precision legal expert app
### Project Overview
Contract Advisor RAG is an ambitious endeavor aimed at revolutionizing the legal industry. By harnessing the power of Hybrid LLM technology, we're striving to build the first fully autonomous artificial contract lawyer. Our journey begins with the development of a powerful contract assistant, with the ultimate objective of creating a sophisticated contract bot capable of independently handling tasks such as drafting, reviewing, and negotiating contract
### Task Description
Our primary task involves building, evaluating, and improving a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system for Contract Q&A (Questions & Answers). This system will enable seamless interaction with contracts, allowing users to ask questions about contract content and receive informative responses.
